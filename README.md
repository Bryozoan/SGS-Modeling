# Shallow Geothermal Systems (SGS)-Modeling
Shallow Geothermal Systems Modeling Project is a project to model heating and cooling for comercial and residential applications. Heating and cooling accounts for as much as 50% of energy useage in the united statest. Although some applications would be difficult to move away from direct electrical or gas applications (i.e. refridgeration or cooking), space heating and cooling, and water heating could benefit significantly by the direct application of shallow geothermal applications. This set of modeling aims to integrate the regional use of heating-cooling, local shallow geology, and current to imerging technologies to better inform the practicality and extent of replacing electrical and hydrocarbon heating/cooling solutions with direct geothermal usage. This could be a pivitol to understanding how to move toward an energy transition, reduce greenhouse gas emission, as well as reduce stress on an increasingly strained electrical grids accross the U.S.

This project aims to incompass the following:
    * 2D Geomodel of shallow temperatures accross the United States
    * Physcis based models of heat flow with diferant geothermal settups 
    * Modeled Comercial and residential homes 
    * Probability model of the likelyhood a various region/size property and home/building would need to have "back up" or additional heating and cooling systems in place
    * Additional systems applications, such as sterling engine electrical production
    * p10, p50, and p90 cases of SGS application with their associated:
        * Aproximate costs/savings in 5-50 year time scale
        * Total CO2 reduction, accounting manufactuing and other externalities
        * Quantified Grid stabalization (reduced peak hour energy demand, reduced grid demand on extream weather days)
        * Qualified advantages (increased lifestyle with reduced CO2 footprint)

The Goal of this modeling is publication in a Geothermal, Energy, or Engineering publication.

The code will be kept available and open source (under MIT licence) to allow for repreducablility, as updates as sinario prevides for modeling peramiter updates (cost, improved geomodel understanding, etc.)
